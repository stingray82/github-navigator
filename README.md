GitHub Navigator - Grease Monkey / Taper Monkey Script
======================================================

This was written out of frustration, I have been completing loads of projects
the last week or so and I have spent a lot of time on GitHub tidying things up
and finishing off projects I started months ago and didn’t finish. Having to
keep navigate to different items particularly my image repo become painful and I
wanted to do something about it

 

 

What does it do?
----------------

Adds a new context menu at the bottom of the right hand side of the screen which
has your last 5 committed repo’s on your top 5 and some quick assess developer
menus all customization within the script

set your GitHub username and if you want it to show your private repo add an
access token with the following requirements
